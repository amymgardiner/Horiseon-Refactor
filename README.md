# Horiseon: Code Refactor

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities and/or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website. Accessible websites are better optimized for search engines, and help companies avoid litigation.

## Updated Code

I have changed the HTML source code to have semantic elements that follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. These elements now include header, nav, section, article, aside, and footer.

Photo and icon images are given accessible and descriptive alt attributes. In our module we learned icon images are decorative and don't need text for their alt attributes, but I went ahead and gave them the attribute of "icon."

I fixed the heading attributes so they now fall in sequential order.

I also changed the title element to be the company's name as a concise and descriptive title.

As a best practice, I also went beyond the acceptance criteria from the company for this module challenge and consolidated their CSS selectors and properties and added comments so they can follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
